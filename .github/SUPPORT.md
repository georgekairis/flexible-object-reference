# Support and Help

Need help getting started or using this project? Here's how.




## How to Get Help

For any usage questions that are not specific to the project itself, please ask for help on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com). By doing so, you are more likely to quickly solve your problem, and you will allow others with the same question to find the answer. This also allows maintainers to focus on improving the project for everyone.

Please seek support in the following ways:

1. **Read the [Manual](../README.md#manual) and other guides**. These should be located in the `root` and/or `Documentation` directories. If there is an example project, explore that to understand how it works and see if it helps answer your question.

1. **Search for answers and ask questions on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com).** This is the most suitable place for debugging issues specific to your use of the project or figuring out how to use the project in a specific way.

1. **As a last resort, open an issue on GitHub.** Clearly explain what you are trying to achieve and list the steps you have already taken to resolve the problem. Provide code samples if necessary, but **DO NOT attach your entire project**. Please review the **[Contributing Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md)** before creating an issue.




## What NOT to Do 

Please **DO NOT** do any the following:

1. Reach out to the author or contributor on Twitter (or other social media) by tweeting or sending a direct message.

1. Email the author or contributor.

1. Open duplicate issues or add "+1" comments to existing issues.

These are not appropriate ways to seek help or support with an open-source project. Instead, follow the guidelines in the previous section. Public questions receive public answers, benefiting everyone in the community. ✌️
